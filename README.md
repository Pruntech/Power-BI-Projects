# Project Name: Chocolate Store Sales


## Objective:
This Power BI project was designed to provide a comprehensive view of the sales performance for a chocolate store by integrating data from a local MySQL database and creating an interactive dashboard for performance analysis.


## Steps Taken:

### Database Integration:
Integrated a local MySQL database with the Power BI project, enabling seamless data import for analysis.\
Database includes:
- (Date Dimension Table) Calendar table
- (Dimension Table) Geographical table
- (Dimension Table) Employees information table
- (Dimension Table) Products information table
- (Fact Table) Sales table

### Data Modeling:
Using Power Query, I validated the data, cleaned it, corrected missing values and removed unnecessary columns.\
In Power BI, I set up relationships and developed a star schema to optimize the data model for reporting.

### Dashboard Creation:
The following key dashboards were created to provide insights into sales performance:

### KPI Dashboard:
Displays two main KPIs: Profit (Revenue - Boxes Cost) and Profitability (Profit / Boxes Count) - Overall and broken down by teams.\
We can see status of our KPIs by last of selected months - current value vs target.

### Profit Dashboard:
Shows the companyâ€™s profit, segmented by date range (months/years), teams, salespeople, and products.\
Allows detailed insight into company profits.

### Profitability Dashboard:
Displays profitability, calculated as profit per unit sold, with the ability to filter by date range (months/years), teams, salespeople, and products.\
Allows to check the status of company profitability.

### Overall Dashboard:
Tracks the sales (Revenue) trend by date (month/year), comparing sales to the previous year. It also displays product profit vs costs comparison and customer trends by date (month/year).

### Products Dashboard:
Identifies the most and the worst profitable products within a selected time period, highlighting the top 3 best-performing products, their sales quantities, and the number of customers who purchased each.

### People Dashboard:
Shows the performance of individual teams and their members, including the highest-grossing team, the team with the highest average profit per person, and the top-performing salesperson.

### Map Dashboard:
Visualizes profit and customer numbers by country, providing insights into regional performance.


### Additional Features:
Each dashboard includes a Navigator for easy navigation between views and a Slicer for filtering data by year and month.\
Interactions between visualizations have been configured to enhance the intuitiveness of data drilling, allowing users to smoothly explore different levels of detail.
