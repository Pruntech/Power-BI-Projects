# Project Name: Chocolate Store Sales


## Objective:
This Power BI project was designed to provide a comprehensive view of the sales performance for a chocolate store by integrating data from a local MySQL database and creating an interactive dashboard for performance analysis.


## Steps Taken:

### Database Integration:
Integrated a local MySQL database with the Power BI project, enabling seamless data import for analysis.

### Data Modeling:
Using Power Query, I validated the data, cleaned it, corrected missing values, and removed unnecessary columns. In Power BI, I set up relationships and developed a star schema to optimize the data model for reporting.

### Dashboard Creation:
The following key dashboards were created to provide insights into sales performance:

### KPI Dashboard:
Displays two main KPIs: Profit and Profitability, broken down by month, and categorized by teams. The data can be viewed overall or drilled down by specific teams.

### Profit Dashboard:
Shows the companyâ€™s profit, segmented by date range, months/years, teams, salespeople, and products. Allows detailed insight into profitability.

### Profitability Dashboard:
Displays profitability, calculated as profit per unit sold, with the ability to filter by date range, months/years, teams, salespeople, and products.

### Overall Dashboard:
Tracks the sales trend month-over-month and year-over-year, comparing sales to the previous year. It also displays product costs, customer trends, and a profit vs. cost comparison by month/year.

### Products Dashboard:
Identifies the most profitable products within a selected time period, highlighting the top 3 best-performing products, their sales quantities, and the number of customers who purchased each.

### People Dashboard:
Shows the performance of individual teams and their members, including the highest-grossing team, the team with the highest average profit per person, and the top-performing salesperson.

### Map Dashboard:
Visualizes profit and customer numbers by country, providing insights into regional performance.


### Additional Features:
Each dashboard includes a Navigator for easy navigation between views and a Slicer for filtering data by year and month.
This structure presents your work in a clear, concise, and professional way, highlighting the key features and objectives of the project.
